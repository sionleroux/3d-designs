# 3D Designs

This git repository tracks 3D models designed by me, Si√¥n le Roux.  These usually include STL files as well as the OpenSCAD source code used to generate them, so that others can use that code to make their own solutions.  I am a novice modeller designing functional (as opposed to artistic) models to solve problems and fill my own needs, tracking my work for later re-use in future projects and sharing the results in case they can be of use to others.
